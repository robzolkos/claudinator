# Resolve Issues in a Pull Request

When you have a pull request (PR) that has unresolved comments, follow these steps to address them:

Use the gh cli to pull in the unresolved comments on that PR and fix those issues.  Once fixed mark those comments as resolved, run rubocop -a and after all tests pass, then push the changes to the PR branch.
